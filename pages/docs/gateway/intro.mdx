# Nakiri Gateway

The Nakiri Gateway is a versatile websocket server that allows clients to be
notified about certain events that are happening within the app. The gateway
does not require any special setup, and is very simple to get started with.

## Gateway URL

```
wss://nakiri.one/gateway
```

## Communicating with the Nakiri Gateway

Once connected to the gateway, you can send and receive messages. A message is
either a **request**, a **response**, or a **notification**. The generic format
of a message is a JSON array with the following format:

```json
[
  "eventName",
  {
    // additional data
  }
]
```

Where `eventName` is the name of the message's type.

The gateway will occasionally ping the clients to check if they are still
connected. This is a generic RFC-6455 ping message. If the client does not send
a pong back to the server, the client will be disconnected.
