# Gateway Notifications

Notifications are messages that the server sends out to clients when certain
events happen. For example, when a new blacklist entry is added, the server will
inform the clients about it.

## General notification flow

Every single time the server sends out a notification to the clients, it will
also assign a unique ID to the notification. Clients will then have to report
back to the server that they have received the notification. This is done using
an ACK message.

**Example notification** (server to client):

```json
[
  "eventName",
  {
    "notificationId": "dfac9fb7-f8cc-464e-aa9a-535aa43571ec"
    // other data
  }
]
```

**Example ACK** (client to server):

```json
[
  "ack",
  {
    "notificationId": "dfac9fb7-f8cc-464e-aa9a-535aa43571ec"
  }
]
```

**Example ACK response** (server to client):

```json
[
  "ack",
  {
    "ok": true,
    "notificationId": "dfac9fb7-f8cc-464e-aa9a-535aa43571ec"
  }
]
```

You may also receive `ok: false` and an error in case something went wrong while
attempting to acknowledge the received notification. The errors can be one of
the following:

| Code                               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `NOTIFICATION_ID_NOT_PROVIDED`     | You are sending an empty ACK to the server.                                                                                                                                                    |
| `NOT_AUTHENTICATED`                | You are not authenticated to the gateway to acknowledge the notification. Please use the [`identify` or `reconnect`](/docs/gateway/sessions) request to establish an authenticated connection. |
| `NOTIFICATION_NOT_FOUND`           | The notification you are trying to acknowledge does not exist.                                                                                                                                 |
| `UNAUTHORIZED_TO_ACK_NOTIFICATION` | You are trying to acknowledge someone else's notification.                                                                                                                                     |
| `UNKNOWN_ERROR`                    | Something went wrong and we have received a report about the error.                                                                                                                            |

## `entryAdded`

These notifications are sent out when a new entry is added to a blacklist the
group has access to (i.e. global blacklist, per-group blacklist, and per-guild
blacklists).

**Example notification:**

```json
[
  "entryAdded",
  {
    "notificationId": "dfac9fb7-f8cc-464e-aa9a-535aa43571ec"
    // BlacklistMutationData
  }
]
```

## `entryRemoved`

These notifications are sent out when an entry is removed from a blacklist the
group has access to.

**Example notification:**

```json
[
  "entryRemoved",
  {
    "notificationId": "dfac9fb7-f8cc-464e-aa9a-535aa43571ec"
    // BlacklistMutationData
  }
]
```
