# Analyzing Messages using the Nakiri Gateway

You can use the Nakiri Gateway to check whether a message contains a forbidden
item. For example, you can check whether a message contains a link to a YouTube
video that you don't want to be posted on your server.

The analyzer will report back whether the message:

- contains a link to a banned YouTube video
- contains a link to a banned YouTube channel
- contains a link to a YouTube video from a banned YouTube channel
- contains a link that matches a forbidden link pattern
- contains an invite to a forbidden Discord server
- contains a phrase that's forbidden

This response will also contain the maximum severity of the offenses, which will
allow you to take action more easily. For example, if a message is caught with
an offense that has a very high severity, you can delete the offending message
and mute its author automatically.

**Note:** the analyzer is still in its proof-of-work stage, so a lot of things
can and will probably break. It's also likely to return false positives,
especially in regards of forbidden phrases. There's also currently no rate
limiting, so please try to use it with caution.

## Requesting an analysis

You can request to analyze a message using the following gateway request:

```json
[
  "analysis",
  {
    "content": "hello please check this cool vid: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ",
    "messageContext": {
      "guildId": "871445016525029417",
      "channelId": "871445017300963341",
      "messageId": "911129474509201448",
      "authorId": "245890903133257730"
    }, // optional
    "options": {
      // optional
    }
  }
]
```

You can learn more about the analysis request [here](/docs/gateway/analyzer/objects/AnalysisRequest).

## After the request

Once you've made the request to analyze a message you will receive nothing in
return. Well, that's a bit harshly worded. The analysis will be added to a queue
system which will eventually be ran and returned to the client through a gateway
notification. The name of the notification is `analysis`.

The notification will have the following body:

```json
[
  "analysis",
  {
    "ok": true,
    "data": {
      "notificationId": "dfac9fb7-f8cc-464e-aa9a-535aa43571ec",
      "content": "hello please check this cool vid: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ",
      "messageContext": {
        "guildId": "871445016525029417",
        "channelId": "871445017300963341",
        "messageId": "911129474509201448",
        "authorId": "245890903133257730"
      },
      "results": {
        // AnalyzerResult
      }
    }
  }
]
```

The `results` field will contain an [AnalyzerResult](/docs/gateway/analyzer/objects/AnalyzerResult)
object. You can learn more about notifications [here](/docs/gateway/notifications).
