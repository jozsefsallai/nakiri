# MessageContext

This is an object that will be passed to the analysis gateway request to include
additional information about the message that triggered the analysis. When the
analysis result arrives, it will contain this data.

## Fields

You can technically pass **anything** to this object, since it will just be
passed back and forth, but this is the official list of attributes it contains:

| Field name  | Type    | Description                                        |
| ----------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `guildId`   | string? | The ID of the guild the message was sent in.       |
| `channelId` | string? | The ID of the channel the message was sent in.     |
| `messageId` | string? | The ID of the message that triggered the analysis. |
| `userId`    | string? | The ID of the user that sent the message.          |
