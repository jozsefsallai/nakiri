# Gateway Sessions

In order to authenticate to the Nakiri Gateway, you have to send your group API
key to the server through an `identify` request. This will create a session for
your client which will be stored for as long as the client is connected, or one
hour after the client disconnects.

## identify

This message is used to create a session for your client after connecting to the
gateway for the first time.

### Request

```json
[
  "identify",
  {
    "apiKey": "a6bc1e6b-6602-4b25-8532-3388825d41cf"
  }
]
```

### Response

On successful authentication, the gateway will create a session for the client
and send back the session ID to you. Your client can save this session ID now in
case the connection drops and you need to reconnect later.

```json
[
  "identify",
  {
    "ok": true,
    "data": {
      "sessionId": "769ae64f-0751-4574-8c66-1ec923358204"
    }
  }
]
```

You may also receive an error in case the authentication was unsuccessful.

```json
[
  "identify",
  {
    "ok": false,
    "error": "[[error code]]"
  }
]
```

Where `[[error code]]` is one of:

| Code                   | Description                                                           |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `API_KEY_NOT_PROVIDED` | You have called the `identify` method but did not provide an API key. |
| `INVALID_API_KEY`      | The API key you provided is invalid/nonexistent.                      |

## reconnect

Your client or the server may unexpectedly drop the connection. In this case,
you can implement a way to reconnect to the gateway's already existing session.
Sessions are persisted for one hour after the client disconnects.

You can reinitialize a session using the session ID you have received from an
`identify` request.

### Request

```json
[
  "reconnect",
  {
    "apiKey": "a6bc1e6b-6602-4b25-8532-3388825d41cf",
    "sessionId": "769ae64f-0751-4574-8c66-1ec923358204"
  }
]
```

### Response

```json
[
  "reconnect",
  {
    "ok": true
  }
]
```

You may also receive an error in case the authentication was unsuccessful.

```json
[
  "reconnect",
  {
    "ok": false,
    "error": "[[error code]]"
  }
]
```

Where `[[error code]]` is one of:

| Code                                      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| `INVALID_SESSION`                         | The session ID you provided is invalid/nonexistent.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `API_KEY_DOES_NOT_MATCH_PREVIOUS_SESSION` | You are trying to reconnect to a session using a different API key than the one you've originally authenticated with. If you want to use a different API key, create a new session instead using the `identify` method. |
| `INVALID_API_KEY`                         | The API key you provided is invalid/nonexistent.                                                                                                                                                                        |
