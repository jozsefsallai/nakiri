# Getting Started

Welcome to the documentation of the Nakiri project. This is where you'll be able
to find instructions about how to use the Nakiri web UI and API, as well as how
to self-host an instance.

## What is Nakiri?

Nakiri is a centralized database for storing and syncing blacklist entries for
communities (primarily targeted towards Hololive fan Discord servers). It
provides:

- A **web UI** for managing users, groups, and blacklist entries,
- A **REST API** for managing blacklists,
- A **WebSocket gateway** for live updates,
- An **analysis endpoint** that allows you to check whether a given message
  contains any problematic content,
- A **worker service** for monitoring keywords on YouTube.

Right now it supports the following blacklist types:

- **YouTube videos**: specify a video ID to prevent people from posting it
- **YouTube channels**: specify a channel ID to prevent people from posting it,
  or videos from that channel
- **Discord servers**: specify the ID of a server to detect malicious invites
- **Link patterns**: specify a regex pattern to detect problematic links
- **Generic phrases**: phrases/substrings that you don't want your members to
  say.

## How To Get Access

Currently, Nakiri is invite-only. You can request an invite by sending an email
to **admin@nakiri.one**. Make sure to include your Discord tag, so we can
discuss the level of access you will get.

Alternatively, you can [self-host Nakiri](/docs/selfhost) yourself and have full
control over the entire ecosystem.
