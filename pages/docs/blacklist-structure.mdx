# How blacklists are structured

As we've discussed in the previous section, Nakiri has multiple blacklist types.
However, most of them share the same logic and structure, in terms of storage,
management, and access.

There are three levels of blacklists:

### Global blacklists

These are blacklists that all Nakiri groups will have access to. When using the
analyzer in non-strict mode, the global blacklists will always be included in
the checks.

Only a select few people can modify the entries in the global blacklists, as
these entries can affect all users of the Nakiri platform.

### Per-group blacklists

Nakiri introduces the concept of [Groups](/docs/what-are-groups). Every group
will have its own set of blacklists, independent of the global blacklists. These
blacklists are only accessible by the members of the group and will be shared
across all guilds of the group.

### Per-guild blacklists

These are blacklists that are only accessible and monitored by a single guild in
a group. These blacklist entries will **always** be checked as long as you
specify a guild ID in your requests.

## Practical example

Consider the following scenario:

<Bleed>
  ![Example for the blacklist hierarchy](/docs-images/groups-hierarchy.png)
</Bleed>

In this example, **Hololive Fan Discords** is a group within Nakiri, which
contains multiple guilds. Each guild's blacklist entries are isolated from each
other and access is defined on a down-to-top level.

This means that the guild named **Gura's Gawrdians** will have access to the
following blacklists:

- **Gura's Gawrdians** (per-guild blacklist)
- **Hololive Fan Discords** (per-group blacklist)
- **Global blacklists**

Similarly, **Ame's Detective Bureau** will have access to the following
blacklists:

- **Ame's Detective Bureau** (per-guild blacklist)
- **Hololive Fan Discords** (per-group blacklist)
- **Global blacklists**

... and so on.
