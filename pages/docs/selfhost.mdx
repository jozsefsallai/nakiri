# Self-hosting Nakiri

Thank you for showing interest in self-hosting Nakiri. A self-hosted instance of
the Nakiri ecosystem will allow you to have full control over your data and its
usage. It will also allow you to modify or extend the app's functionality.

The code is licensed under the MIT license, so you can do whatever you want
without any restrictions.

The only possible drawback of running a self-hosted instance is that you won't
have access to the global Nakiri database, but depending on your use case, this
might be exactly what you want to do.

## Minimum hardware requirements

- **CPU**: at least 2 cores
- **RAM**: at least 2 GB, but more is recommended
- **Storage**: at least 2 GB, not including the space required for installing
  certain dependencies + the space required for the database as well as the
  Redis data

Generally you'd be able to run Nakiri on any server/VPS that's not very minimal.
For reference, the official instance is running on a VPS with 2 cores, 2 GB of
RAM, and 40 GB of storage.

## Getting started

There are two ways you can get Nakiri running on your own server.

1. Using Docker and Docker Compose
2. Manual installation

### Self-hosting using Docker and Docker Compose

**Prerequisites**:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- git

**1. Clone the repository**

```sh
git clone git@github.com:jozsefsallai/nakiri.git
cd nakiri
```

**2. Configure your instance**

```sh
cp .env.example .env
nano .env
```

**3. Start it all**

```sh
docker-compose up -d
```

To shut the app down, just run:

```sh
docker-compose down
```

### Self-hosting manually

**Prerequisites**:

- git
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v12 or newer
- MySQL or MariaDB
- Redis
- A process manager like [pm2](https://www.pm2.io/)
- Go

First, you have to clone the repository:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:jozsefsallai/nakiri.git
cd nakiri
```

Once that is done, create a database for the app:

```sh
mysql -u root -p
```

```sql
CREATE USER ayame@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'nakiri';
CREATE DATABASE nakiriapi;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON nakiriapi.* TO ayame@localhost WITH GRANT OPTION;
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
exit;
-- note: you might want to use better/more secure credentials
```

Lastly, you have to change the configuration file:

```sh
cp .env.example .env
nano .env
```

#### Building and running Nakiri

**Install the dependencies using Yarn:**

```sh
npm i -g yarn
yarn
```

**Run the migrations:**

```sh
yarn migrate
```

**Authorize the first Discord user:**

```sh
node bin/authorizeUser
```

It is recommended that you grant all permissions to the first user.

**Build the app:**

```sh
yarn build
```

**Start the app:**

```sh
yarn start
```

If you want the app to run continuously, you can use a process manager like PM2.

In production environments, you may want to add this as a crontab entry and run
it on a tidy schedule:

```
NODE_ENV=production node bin/updateUsers
```

#### Building and running Nakiri Workers

**Open the `workers` directory:**

```sh
cd workers
```

**Build the binary:**

```
go build .
```

**Then run it:**

```
./workers
```
