# What are groups?

Groups are a single organizational unit that can contain multiple members and
guilds. Each group has its own API key that can be used to interact with the
Nakiri API and WebSocket gateway.

Groups have their own global blacklist as well per-guild blacklists. See the
[How blacklists are structured](/docs/blacklist-structure) section for more
details on how it works.
