# Removing groups

This feature has its separate documentation entry because it's one of the most
destructive features in Nakiri.

If you are the owner of a group, you will see a button that will allow you to
remove it. This, however, is very destructive, as it will remove everything that
is associated to the group, including:

- The group itself
- The list of guilds that belong to the group
- Group memberships
- Per-group blacklist entries
- Per-guild blacklist entries

The removal of this data is **irreversible**, so the app will prompt you several
times before actually performing the removal. Please be careful with this.
