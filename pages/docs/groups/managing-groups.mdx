# Managing groups

You can create and manage a group through the Nakiri web interface.

1. Go to https://nakiri.one/manage/login
1. Log in using an authorized Discord account
1. Click on the **Groups** link in the menu bar (or just click [here](https://nakiri.one/manage/groups))

On this page, you will see every group you've created or are a member of. You
can also use the **Create Group** button in the top right corner to create a new
group.

## Creating a group

To create a group, click on the **Create Group** button in the top right corner
and on the following page, specify the name of the group and an optional
description. Don't worry, you can change these later.

Once you've filled in the fields, click on the **Create** button and the group
will be created. You can now invite other users to the group and add Discord
guilds to it.

## Adding Discord guilds

The main purpose of a group is to encapsulate multiple Discord servers in it, so
they can all share the same per-group global blacklist and have individual
blacklists as well. This is useful in scenarios where the same bot is used
across multiple guilds.

Before adding a guild to a Nakiri group, you have to authorize it within Nakiri.
You can only do this if you have at least `MANAGE_MESSAGES` in the guild you
want to authorize. Any other guild will not show up in your list.

You can authorize a Discord guild by going to the **My Guilds** page and
clicking on the **Add Guild** button. From that page, you can select the guild
you want to authorize and it will be authorized immediately.

If someone else has already authorized the guild you want to add, you will see
it in the list of your guilds.

Once the guild you want to add has been authorized, you can go back to the
group's page and click on the **Add guild** button. You will see a popup asking
you to select the guild you want to add.

  You will only be able to add a guild to a group if your group membership has
  the `MANAGE_GROUP_GUILDS` permission.
</Callout>

## Removing Discord guilds

On the group's page you will see a **Remove** button next to each guild. You can
click on this button to remove the guild from the group. The app will prompt you
to confirm the removal.

<Callout emoji="ℹ️">
  Removing a guild from a group will not remove the blacklist entries associated
  to that guild in the group. Therefore, if you re-add the guild to the group,
  all previously added blacklist entries will still be present. Removing a guild
  from a group will also not unauthorize it from Nakiri.

<Callout emoji="⚠️" type="warning">
  You will only be able to remove a guild from a group if your group membership
  has the `MANAGE_GROUP_GUILDS` permission.
</Callout>

## Adding group members

On the group's page you will see a button called **Add member**. Clicking on it
will prompt you for the user's Discord ID. Note that this has to be the Discord
account's numerical ID and **not** the username + discriminator combination.

You will only be able to add a user to a group if the user you want to add has
been authorized to access Nakiri. If the user you want to add is not authorized,
please talk to an administrator to get them authorized.

When adding a user to a group, you will be able to choose between the following
permissions for them:

- **View the group's blacklists** - allows them to view the group's blacklist
  entries.
- **Manage group blacklist entries** - allows them to add, edit, and remove
  blacklist entries.
- **See the group's API key** - if this permission is enabled, the user will be
  able to see the group's API key. Generally, you only want a few select people,
  or only the group's owner, to be able to see the API key, as it gives you
  programmatic access to everything in the group.
- **Manage group guilds** - allows them to add and remove guilds from the group.
- **Manage group members** - allows them to add and remove members from the
  group.

<Callout emoji="ℹ️">
  A user will only be able to access a group's global blacklist, as well as the
  blacklists of every guild they have access to. In this context, having access
  to a guild means having at least `MANAGE_MESSAGES` permission in said guild.
</Callout>

<Callout emoji="⚠️" type="warning">
  You will only be able to add a user to a group if your group membership has
  the `MANAGE_GROUP_MEMBERS` permission.
</Callout>

## Removing group members

On the group's page, you will see a **Remove** button next to each member in the
members list. Clicking on this button will prompt you to confirm the removal,
and once confirmed, will remove the member from the group.

Permissions are not preserved, so removing a member from a group and then adding
them again allows you to specify new permissions to them.

  You will only be able to remove a user from a group if your group membership
  has the `MANAGE_GROUP_MEMBERS` permission.
