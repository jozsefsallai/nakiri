# Introduction to the Nakiri HTTP API

Nakiri provides a simple REST API to access blacklist entries as well as add new
ones.

Please note that most of these API endpoints will need to be authenticated using
a [group API key](/docs/groups/what-are-groups). If an endpoint doesn't require
authentication, we will make sure to mention that.

**Nakiri provides API access to the following resources:**

- [YouTube videos](/docs/http-api/endpoints/youtube-videos)
- [YouTube channels](/docs/http-api/endpoints/youtube-channels)
- [Link patterns](/docs/http-api/endpoints/link-patterns)
- [Discord guilds](/docs/http-api/endpoints/discord-guilds)
- [Generic phrases](/docs/http-api/endpoints/phrases)

## Common query parameters

For blacklist-related API endpoints, there are several query parameters that you
can use in your requests.

### `compact`

- **type**: `boolean`, **default**: `true`

Will return a compact response for each blacklist entry. A compact response is
a response that only contains the most important data (i.e. an array of video
IDs, link patterns, etc.). It will not contain any other data about the
blacklist entry, such as the metadata (if applicable), description, added date,
severity, etc.

By default, the compact response is returned. If you want to get the full
response for each blacklist entry, you can use the `compact=false` query.

When compact mode is disabled, the response will contain the full data object of
the blacklisted entries, which will be elaborated in the following sections.

### `strict`

- **type**: `boolean`, **default**: `false`

Toggles strict mode. In strict mode, only the entries that belong to a given
group/guild will be returned.

For example, if a `group` parameter is also supplied, only the per-group entries
of the group will be returned. If a `guild` parameter is also supplied, only the
per-guild entries from the the guild from the supplied group will be returned.

This query parameter is only available for `GET` requests.

### `group`

- **type**: `string`

The ID of the group whose entries you want to include in your request.

When supplied to a `GET` request, in addition to global blacklist entries, the group's per-group
entries will be returned as well. This will not return entries that belong to
guilds within the group.

You can use the `strict` query parameter to omit global blacklist entries.

When supplied to a `POST` request, the blacklist entry will be added to the
group's per-group blacklist.

### `guild`

- **type**: `string`

The Discord ID of the guild whose entries you want to include in your request.
When specifying this query parameter, you must also specify a `group`.

When supplied to a `GET` request, in addition to global blacklist entries and per-group entries,
the group's per-guild entries will be returned as well.

You can use the `strict` query parameter to omit global blacklist entries and
per-group entries.

When supplied to a `POST` request, the blacklist entry will be added to the
guild's own blacklist from within the provided group.

## Pagination

Nakiri offers two ways to limit the results within the response and paginate
between them, depending on use case.

### Offset-based pagination

This is the kind of pagination you'd see on most websites and it's also what the
web UI uses.

For each blacklist, you can specify the following query parameters in a `GET`
request:

- **`page`**: The page number you want to retrieve. The first page is 1, which
  is also the default value if you don't supply this parameter. Negative page
  numbers will default to 1. If a page exceeds the number of pages available, an
  empty array of results will be returned.
- **`limit`**: The number of entries you want to retrieve per page. The default
  limit is 25. The maximum limit is 50. If you supply a higher limit, the
  maximum limit will be used instead.

Each response will contain a pagination object:

```json
"pagination": {
  "page": 1, // the current page
  "limit": 25, // the limit per page
  "pageCount": 8, // the number of available pages
  "totalCount": 178, // the total number of entries
  "hasPrevious": false, // whether there is a page before the current one
  "hasNext": true // whether there's a page after the current one
},
```

**When you should use this pagination method:**

- You want to know ahead how many pages there are.
- You want to know the previous page.

**When you should NOT use this pagination method:**

- You don't want to skip entries in case an entry gets deleted during
  pagination.
- You want to have more granular control over the starting point of the
  pagination mechanism.

### Cursor-based pagination

This is the recommended way to paginate between entries in API consumers. It
allows you to specify a unique cursor and a limit to only return the first `n`
results starting from that cursor. The distinction between the pagination
methods is done using the `cursor` query parameter. If supplied, the API will
paginate using the cursor-based method, otherwise it will default to
offset-based pagination.

You can specify the following query parameters in a `GET` request:

- **`cursor`**: The cursor you want to start from. For the first page, the value
  of this parameter should be `0`. This is the base64-encoded string of an
  entry's numerical ID. You will be able to see the next cursor in the
  pagination response. If you supply an invalid cursor, the API will return the
  first page.
- **`limit`**: The number of entries you want to retrieve per page. The default
  limit is 25. The maximum limit is 50. If you supply a higher limit, the
  maximum limit will be used instead.

Each response will contain a pagination object:

```json
"pagination": {
  "limit": 25, // the limit of the response array
  "remainingItems": 153, // how many items are there left to consume
  "nextCursor": "MjY5NTc3ODcwOTY0MTgxNDAxNg" // the cursor of the next page
}
```

**When you should use this pagination method:**

- You care about consuming all entries, even if deletions happen in-between
  paginations.

**When you should NOT use this pagination method:**

- You want to move backwards in the pagination. There is no way to know the
  previous cursor, creating a pagination UI will not be an easy task.

## Generic API request

When making a request to the API, you have to provide the `Authorization` header
with the value of your API key. You can get the API key from the group's page if
you have the necessary permissions to do that.

Here is an example in JavaScript:

```js
fetch('https://nakiri.one/api/lists/something', {
  method: 'GET',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': '<token>',
  },
});
```

## Generic API response

Each API response will contain the following fields:

- **`ok`**: boolean, specifying whether or not the request was successful.
- **`error`**: string, specifying an error code if the request failed.
- **`...`** (optional): the main field that the request needs to return (for
  example, `phrases` would be an array of phrase blacklist entries). This field
  will not be included if the request failed. Some requests do not have to
  return this custom field.
- **`pagination`** (optional): pagination object, if the request was successful
  and it's a paginated request.

**Example response (successful blacklist query):**

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "pagination": {
    "limit": 25,
    "remainingItems": 153,
    "nextCursor": "MjY5NTc3ODcwOTY0MTgxNDAxNg"
  },
  "videoIDs": [
    // ...
  ]
}
```

**Example response (failed request):**

```json
{
  "ok": false,
  "error": "INSUFFICIENT_PERMISSIONS"
}
```
