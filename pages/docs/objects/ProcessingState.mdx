# ProcessingState

This is an enum that represents the processing state of a YouTube video or
channel entry. When adding an entry to these blacklists, Nakiri will start a
background job to fetch metadata about the entry.

The following processing states exist:

- `QUEUED = 0` - if the entry was queued for metadata retrieval
- `PENDING = 1` - if the entry is currently being processed
- `DONE = 2` - if the entry has been processed
- `FAILED = 3` - if the entry failed to be processed

API responses will return the numerical representation of the processing state.
