## User Permissions

User permissions are stored as a bitfield. Each permission corresponds to a bit
that is a power of 2. These permissions are then added together to form the
user's permission set. The values are stored as 32-bit signed integers.

| Bit value | Name                          | Description                                                    |
| --------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `1`       | `MANAGE_OWN_GUILD_BLACKLISTS` | Whether the user can manage blacklists of their own guilds.    |
| `2`       | `MANAGE_GLOBAL_BLACKLISTS`    | Whether the user can manage the global Nakiri blacklists.      |
| `4`       | `MANAGE_AUTHORIZED_USERS`     | Whether the user authorize or unauthorize users to Nakiri.     |
| `8`       | `MANAGE_MONITORED_KEYWORDS`   | Whether the user can manage the monitored keywords in a guild. |
| `16`      | `CREATE_GROUPS`               | Whether the user can create and manage groups.                 |

To check if a user has a permission, use the following example:

```js
(user.permissions & CREATE_GROUPS) === CREATE_GROUPS;
```
