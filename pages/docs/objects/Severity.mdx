# Severity

The severity enum represents how severe a blacklist entry is. This can be used
by clients to determine what actions to take when someone posts a message that
contains a blacklisted entry.

The following severity levels are available:

- `VERY_LOW = 0`
- `LOW = 1`
- `MEDIUM = 2`
- `HIGH = 3`
- `VERY_HIGH = 4`

API responses will return the numerical representation of the severity level.
