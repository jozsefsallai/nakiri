# GroupMember

This model defines a group-user relationship. It also stores the permission
levels of a member.

## Fields

| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`          | string                                         | The [Snowflake ID](/docs/objects/Snowflake) of the entry. |
| `user`        | [AuthorizedUser](/docs/objects/AuthorizedUser) | The user's data object.                                   |
| `group`       | [Group](/docs/objects/Group)                   | The group's data object.                                  |
| `permissions` | [GroupMemberPermissions](#member-permissions)  | The permissions of the member.                            |

## Member permissions

Member permissions are stored as a bitfield. Each permission corresponds to a
bit that is a power of 2. These permissions are then added together to form the
member's permission set. The values stored are 32-bit signed integers.
